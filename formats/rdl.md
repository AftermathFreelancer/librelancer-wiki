# RDL Text

Infocards stored in Freelancer resource .dlls are stored in an XML format referred to as RDL. These are encoded as UTF-16 text with a BOM. 
 
Sample infocard:
 
 ```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?>
<RDL>
    <PUSH/>
    <TEXT>Welcome to the Librelancer infocard example XML!</TEXT>
    <PARA/>
    <TEXT>This is the second paragraph</TEXT>
    <POP/>
</RDL>
```
